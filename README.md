## üì• Installation

To get started with the YOLOv8 Vehicle Damage Detector, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NabilNawa/YOLOv8-Vehicle-Damage-Detector.git
   cd YOLOv8-Vehicle-Damage-Detector
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Pretrained Model**:
   You can find the pretrained model in the [Releases section](https://github.com/NabilNawa/YOLOv8-Vehicle-Damage-Detector/releases). Download the model file and place it in the appropriate directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To use the YOLOv8 Vehicle Damage Detector, follow these instructions:

1. **Prepare Your Images**: Ensure your images are in the correct format and placed in the designated folder.

2. **Run Inference**:
   You can run inference using the provided script:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --source path/to/your/images --weights path/to/pretrained/model
   ```

3. **View Results**: The results will be saved in the output directory specified in the script.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Model Training

If you want to train the model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is structured correctly. You will need images and corresponding annotation files in YOLO format.

2. **Modify Configuration**: Update the configuration files to point to your dataset.

3. **Train the Model**:
   Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data path/to/dataset.yaml --cfg path/to/yolov8.yaml --weights path/to/initial/weights
   ```

4. **Monitor Training**: Use TensorBoard or similar tools to monitor the training process.

## üìä Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the model, you can use the evaluation script provided:

```bash
python evaluate.py --weights path/to/trained/model --data path/to/evaluation/data
```

This will give you metrics such as precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).
